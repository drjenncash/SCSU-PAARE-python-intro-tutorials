    "A function is simply a piece of code that performs a task, which might take some inputs and might return some outputs. The input and output could be a number, an array, a string, or any other data type. This will, of course, depend on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote> Clarification:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The terms *parameter* and *argument* can be used for the same thing: information that is passed into a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "    From a function's perspective:\n",
    "    * A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.\n",
    "    * An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",

Functions are very important for achieving all of the above, with utmost simplicity. Functions are also very useful if you want the same task to be performed repeatedly, with no changes, or maybe with minor modifications. For example, if you want to evaluate that polynomial repeatedly, then it is better to define a function to do so; otherwise, simple typing mistakes in one of those lines might break your code. Or if you want to now change your polynomial coefficients, and you have 100 repetitions of the code, then you'll have to go line by line to each of those. \n",
