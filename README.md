# SCSU-PAARE-tutorials
Holding space for the tutorials being created in the PAARE project with SC State, Clemson, and UVI

**Primary Purpose:**

These tutorials are designed to introduce our project participants to the Python programming language with an emphasis on Data Science and a slant toward the Astronomy of variable sources. 

It is expected that the notebooks will also be valuable as a starting place for others learning Python for astronomy. 

The content inside these tutorials draws heavily from a wide variety of websites, user guides, and existing tutorials.
